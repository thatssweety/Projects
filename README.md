# Projects
## Project 1 : [Handwriting Recognition and classification Of Hindi Vowels](https://thatssweety.github.io/Handwriting-Recognition-and-Classification-Of-Hindi-Vowels/)
- Created [MNIST Dataset](https://github.com/thatssweety/Handwriting-Recognition-and-Classification-Of-Hindi-Vowels/blob/main/Dataset%20Vowels.zip) for Hindi vowels (13 classes) from scratch  
- Build a multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow and Keras  
- Achieved  over the accuracy of 97 percent on the validation set  
- Tech Stack used - Python, Tensorflow, Computer Vision, CNN Classifier  
## Project 2 : [Mall Customer Segmentation](https://thatssweety.github.io/Mall-Customer-Segmentation/)
- Used the K-means algorithm to segment the customers according to similar characteristics (Kaggle Dataset).  
- Used elbow method  to find an optimal number of clusters
